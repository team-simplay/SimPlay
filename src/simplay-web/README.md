# simplay-web

This package can be used to spool and display a set of events received in the simplay syntax.
Usually its used to spool a set of events generated by [simplay](https://pypi.org/project/simplay/).

## API

There are cases in which you may want to use `simplay-web` directly, e.g. if you have a custom event generator
and want to spool these events.

### EventQueue

The structure of the expected EventQueue can be found in [SimulationData.ts](./src/SimulationData.ts).

### SimulationSpooler

To spool and display an EventQueue the [SimulationSpooler](./src/SimulationSpooler.ts) has to be used.
A description for all functions is available in the TypeDoc of the [SimulationSpooler](./src/SimulationSpooler.ts).
