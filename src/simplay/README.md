# SimPlay

*Hint: What you probably want to do, is install [simplay-jupyter](https://pypi.org/project/simplay-jupyter/) which bundles simplay with simplay-web, and allows you to run this project within JupyterLab.*

Enhance [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/) simulations with animation details.
More Information can be found in the [SimPlay Documentation](https://simplay.readthedocs.io/).

## Install

To install the package, execute:

```bash
pip install simplay
```
